Installing Flutter SDK on Windows
Step 1: Download the Flutter SDK
Download the latest stable release of the Flutter SDK from the official Flutter website.
Step 2: Create a Folder for Flutter
Create a directory to install Flutter.
You can create a directory at %USERPROFILE% (e.g., C:\Users\{username}\dev) or %LOCALAPPDATA% (e.g., C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local).
Step 3: Extract the Flutter SDK
Extract the downloaded Flutter SDK file into the directory you created.
The Flutter SDK should be in the C:\Users\{username}\dev\flutter directory.
Step 4: Add Flutter to the PATH Environment Variable
To run Flutter commands in PowerShell, add Flutter to the PATH environment variable.

Press Windows + Pause (or Windows + Fn + B if your keyboard lacks a Pause key).
The System > About dialog will display.
Click Advanced System Settings.
In the Advanced tab, click Environment Variables....
In the User variables for (username) section, look for the Path entry.
If the Path Entry Exists
Double-click on the Path entry.
The Edit Environment Variable dialog will display.
Double-click in an empty row and type %USERPROFILE%\dev\flutter\bin.
Click the %USERPROFILE%\dev\flutter\bin entry and click Move Up until it sits at the top of the list.
Click OK three times.
If the Path Entry Doesn't Exist
Click New....
The Edit Environment Variable dialog will display.
In the Variable Name box, type Path.
In the Variable Value box, type %USERPROFILE%\dev\flutter\bin.
Click OK three times.
Step 5: Enable the Changes
Close and reopen any existing command prompts and PowerShell instances.
You have now installed the Flutter SDK and configured the PATH environment variable. You can start using Flutter commands in PowerShell.
